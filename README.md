## resume site

A basic resume site, trying to update my old resume site structure to more modern tools and libraries. Someday I intend to actually have real code, but for now it is just text and some animations.

Written in typescript, the build code will be checked in so github pages can host it without having to rely on an external service.

`yarn start`

precommit hook runs `yarn build` and adds the build code to the commit

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
